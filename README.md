# WeatherApp-Vaadin8
Weather Web App created using Springboot &amp; Vaadin 8.\
I used JAVA Spring-Boot with Vaadin-8 Frameworks.\
I've used Vaadin-8 for the Design & Structure Layout.\
Spring-Boot is used for integrating API Service onto the Code.\
I've used "OKHTTP3" & "android-JSON" for Requesting & Getting Response from the API. I've used "https://openweathermap.org/api" for the Weather API.\
